# YOLO-Based-Digit-Detection-for-LED-Displays


At LECA factory, we needed a reliable system to monitor, control, and store critical parameters of certain machines such as amperage and temperature. Some of these values are highly sensitive and require immediate operator notification in case of significant changes.
To address this need, we developed a computer vision system using YOLO, trained on a large dataset containing images of standard digits and industrial 7-segment LED displays.
Using YOLOv8 and training over 120 epochs, we achieved high accuracy in digit recognition and successfully deployed the system in an industrial environment.
