# üî¢ Industrial 7-Segment Digit Recognition System

At LECA factory, we needed a reliable system to monitor, control, and store critical parameters of certain machines such as amperage and temperature. Some of these values are highly sensitive and require immediate operator notification in case of significant changes.
To address this need, we developed a computer vision system using YOLO, trained on a large dataset containing images of standard digits and industrial 7-segment LED displays.
Using YOLOv8 and training over 120 epochs, we achieved high accuracy in digit recognition and successfully deployed the system in an industrial environment.

To solve this, we built a **YOLOv8-based digit recognition system** trained on a diverse dataset of segmented digits. The system performs the following:

- Captures and preprocesses LED images from a fixed camera
- Masks irrelevant screen areas and enhances contrast
- Detects digits using YOLOv8
- Checks for upward trends in values using first-order difference
- Sends SMS alerts in critical cases
- Saves data to a database for analysis

## üìà First-Order Difference (Trend Detection)

To detect rising trends in numeric values, we use a discrete approximation of the **first-order derivative**:

### Mathematical Formulation

Given a sequence of values \( x_0, x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \), the first-order difference is defined as:

![Delta x](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}\Delta%20x_i%20=%20x_{i+1}%20-%20x_i)

### Python Implementation

```python
def first_order_difference(arr: list) -> bool:
    positive_steps = sum(1 for i in range(len(arr) - 1) if arr[i+1] > arr[i])
    return positive_steps / (len(arr) - 1) >= 0.6
```

## üß™ Image Preprocessing

Images are first cropped, then specific regions are masked (e.g. irrelevant parts of the display), followed by contrast enhancement, sharpening, and Gaussian blurring. This prepares the image for YOLO detection.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Job Scheduler

A custom scheduler based on Python‚Äôs threading.Timer runs the image capture and processing task every 200 seconds:

```python
class JobScheduler:
    def __init__(self, interval_seconds, job_func):
        self.interval_seconds = interval_seconds
        self.job_func = job_func

    def start(self):
        self._schedule_next_run()

    def _schedule_next_run(self):
        self.job_func()
        Timer(self.interval_seconds, self._schedule_next_run).start()
```

This ensures periodic, non-blocking execution of the job.
